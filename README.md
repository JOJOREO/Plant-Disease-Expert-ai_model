Abstract:
The identification, assessment, and quantification of plant diseases using digital technologies is a significant research frontier. New and dependable methods would be helpful for growers, for whom early disease identification can mean the difference between successful intervention and severe losses, and for plant breeders, who frequently must rely on laborious visual phenotyping.

Core Ideas:
•	With a 78% accuracy rate, a deep learning algorithm recognised plant illness in UAV photos.

•	This technique identified signs of plant disease at a very limited coverage scale.





Introduction:
Plant disease is a change to a plant's healthy state that prevents or modifies the plant's vital functions. Disease can affect any plant species. Even though each species is prone to certain diseases, these are always relatively uncommon. Depending on the crops and kinds planted, the environmental conditions present, and the occurrence and prevalence of plant diseases, these factors change from season to season. While some plant kinds are more vulnerable to disease outbreaks than others, others are. Observe the list of plant illnesses as well.

Direct visual examination of the leaves yields important insights into the health of the plant. Many infections, diseases, parasites, and deficits that affect plants during their growth and life cycles can be detected for the first time in their leaves. The primary factors limiting agricultural productivity include biotic and abiotic stresses, which can result in significant production losses.
